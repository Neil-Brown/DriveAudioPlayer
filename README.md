## Why Drive Audio Player?

Streaming apps are great for discovery, but frustrating when:

* Ads interrupt your listening
* Algorithms decide what you hear
* Your own music library is hard to manage

Drive Audio Player gives you a clean, focused way to listen to **music you already own**.

## Privacy & Security (Important)

Drive Audio Player is designed with **minimal access** in mind.

This keeps your data private and under your control.
